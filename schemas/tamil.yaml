# Notes for developers
notes: |
  This schema represents Tamil script with scholarly extensions for Sanskrit.
  Superscript notation follows academic conventions:
  - ² = aspirated/voiceless variant
  - ³ = voiced variant  
  - ⁴ = aspirated voiced variant
  
  The build system should generate:
  1. HashMap<String, String> for complex mappings
  2. Efficient string processing with superscript detection
  3. Fallback to basic Tamil for non-Sanskrit content
